# A collection of Hubot scripts

See `# Commands` in each script comment section for specific usage in chat.


* [Emoji](emoji/) - A random-esque displayer of the Slack built in Emoji. Won't make much sense outside of the Slack specific `:smile:` style Emoji useable in chat. 
  * Uses a **nix-ish* `$ {command}` format.
* [generic_imageme](generic_imageme/) - Non `@hubot` style image loading. Also allows random image via `randomword.setgetgo.com` word API. 
  * Uses a **nix-ish* `$ {command}` format.
* [Marco Polo](MarcoPolo/) - Answers `"Polo!"` when it hears `Marco`. A (very small) pure Javascript example (when I was first looking at Hubot, there were not many pure `.js` examples to play with)
* [Wake Up](WakeUp/) - `@hubot` Random responses when hearing `wake up` (simple usage of `msg.random` method).
* [Yoda](Yoda/) - Alters your text in a Yoda-esque fashion via the `https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak#` API.
